`opendatatoronto` is an R interface to the [City of Toronto Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/). The goal of the package is to help read data directly into R without needing to manually download it via the portal. 

For more information, please visit the [package website](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/) and vignettes:

* [Introduction to `opendatatoronto`](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/articles/opendatatoronto.html)
* [Retrieving multi-sheet XLS/XLSX resources](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/articles/articles/multisheet_resources.html)
* [Retrieving multi-file ZIP resources](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/articles/articles/multifile_zip_resources.html)
* [Retrieving multiple resources using `purrr`](https://sharlagelfand.github.io/opendatatoronto/articles/articles/multiple_resources_purrr.html)

## Installation

You can intall the released version of opendatatoronto from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("opendatatoronto")
```

or the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("sharlagelfand/opendatatoronto", ref = "main")
```

## Usage

In the Portal, datasets are called **packages**. You can see a list of available packages by using `list_packages()`. This will show metadata about the package, including what topics (i.e. tags) the package covers, any civic issues it addresses, a description of it, how many resources there are (and their formats), how often it is is refreshed and when it was last refreshed.

```{r list-packages-example}
library(opendatatoronto)
packages <- list_packages(limit = 10)
packages
```

You can also search packages by title:

```{r search-packages-example}
ttc_packages <- search_packages("ttc")

ttc_packages
```

Or see metadata for a specific package:

```{r show-packages-example}
show_package("996cfe8d-fb35-40ce-b569-698d51fc683b")
```

Within a package, there are a number of **resources** - e.g. CSV, XSLX, JSON, SHP files, and more. Resources are the actual "data".

For a given package, you can get a list of resources using `list_package_resources()`. You can pass it the package id (which is contained in `marriage_license_packages` below):

```{r list-marriage-license-resources}
marriage_licence_packages <- search_packages("Marriage Licence Statistics")

marriage_licence_resources <- marriage_licence_packages %>%
  list_package_resources()

marriage_licence_resources
```

But you can also get a list of resources by using the package's URL from the Portal:

```{r list-resources-url}
list_package_resources("https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/sexual-health-clinic-locations-hours-and-services/")
```

Finally (and most usefully!), you can download the resource (i.e., the actual data) directly into R using `get_resource()`:

```{r get-marriage-licenses}
marriage_licence_statistics <- marriage_licence_resources %>%
  head(1) %>%
  get_resource()

marriage_licence_statistics
```
